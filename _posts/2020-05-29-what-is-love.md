After Becky and Jake were married, Becky continued with one of Jake’s family traditions by making chicken soup every Friday evening. However, try as she might, Jake would always say, “Becky, your soup is very good, but it’s not as good as my mother’s.”
So Becky bought the best ingredients, changed the spices, tried with more vegetables, and still heard, “Thank you  making me this soup. If only it were as good as my mother used to make.”


One Friday afternoon, Becky went down to the basement to take the clothes out of the washer and put them into the dryer when she discovered that the washing machine had overflowed and there was a tide of sudsy water covering the floor.
By the time Becky got the mess cleaned up and returned back upstairs, she realized that the soup was burnt. Frantic because it was too late to get another chicken and
start over, Becky set the table and decided to serve the soup anyway and hope for the best. When Jake got home and sat down to eat, she placed a bowl in front of him and returned to the kitchen for bread. “Becky, get in here!” Jake bellowed. Cringing, she returned.


“Becky, this soup. Finally, it’s just like my mother’s!” When you are looking for a loving partner, you may automatically have a hidden agenda to look for the things you
experienced as a child that you associated with love, even if they are not necessarily things that you would want in a partner from an adult  perspective. Like with the chicken soup analogy, you may pick a partner with the same attributes that you saw in your first love, your mother or father. If so, you will look for a man or a woman who embodies those old familiar ways of being or relating, even if, in truth, they are not something you as an adult would prefer.

 A child’s mind is not discerning. Love from a parent can
come with extras attached, such as anger, frustration, etc. Without awareness, you may unwittingly be repeating a family tradition rather than choosing a partner who truly fits. If you grew up in a family that argues, you will look for a partner who will fight with you because that is your schematic for love. With awareness, you can reveal what has been hidden. If you don’t judge yourself for being attracted to people with  “bad” attributes, the way will be open to build a partnership with your current mate. Or perhaps it will be with a new partner who will satisfy your adult desires for relationship rather
than fulfi lling your child’s idea of love.
