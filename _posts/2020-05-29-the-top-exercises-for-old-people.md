We people have this obligation to keep our bodies fit and healthy. We do this by means of exercise. There are many different exercises that we try to do. Some of the exercises we do are for strength, some are for flexibility, some for agility and some for just building the body. Whatever exercise it is, exercise still demands a lot of effort and this could be easily done when you are young and able. But then there is one bit of a problem. Nobody stays young.

In time, you would also get wrinkled skin and decreased strength. When you get old and lose all that flexibility and strength that you have while you were young, does it mean that you should stop being fit? Could you still do your obligation to yourself of being fit and healthy by means of exercise? Good thing is that there are exercises for old people. That is why the answer to the last question would definitely be a yes.

Age doesn't excuse anyone from the task of keeping their bodies fit. Not even old people.
