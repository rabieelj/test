If you want to create a working, supportive relationship with
another, it is imperative that you be willing to be complete in
the relationship you have with your parents. The dictionary
defines complete as “lacking no component part; full; whole;
entire.” But what does being incomplete with your parents
mean? It is when you are looking to prove them wrong or right
for what they did, or didn’t do, or when you endlessly search
for their weak points.

When you reference how you are living your life in comparison to how your parents have lived their lives and to what
they did or didn’t do for you, then you are incomplete. If, for
example, in your opinion they were either there too much and
smothered you or they were not there enough and you felt
abandoned and misunderstood, these are symptoms of being
incomplete. One way or the other, your source of identity is
in relation and reaction to your parents. If you are saying that
your parents are responsible for the way you relate, then you
are incomplete with them.

We have seen many adults who were children of highly successful people be failures in life and relationship because they
wanted to prove to their parents that their parents did it wrong.
Any time things started going too well, these people would sabotage the possibility of their own success. Being right was more important than being happy. The aversion to being like one’s
parents is nondiscriminatory; you can’t just pick and choose the
parts of them you don’t want to be like. If you are trying to not
be like them, you will avoid even their “good” traits.
