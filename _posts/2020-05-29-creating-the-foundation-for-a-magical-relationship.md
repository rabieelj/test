 As you begin reading this book, ask yourself why you have picked it up. Is it because you have heard good things about it? Were you attracted to the title or cover?
Perhaps you are stuck somewhere on your personal journey toward creating a magical relationship. Or perhaps you are searching for tips
to fi x your partner so that he or she is less irritating. Maybe
you are simply curious. Any reason is valid. To get the most
from all that How to Create a Magical Relationship has to offer, it is
important that you begin to know yourself.
Since you have picked up this book, chances are you are interested in having relationships that are rewarding to you and to the people with whom you relate. In the following pages, you are likely to come across things that you do and have done naturally all along that work well in your dealings with others. You will also identify things that are impediments to your ability to have a day-to-day sense of well-being. Both are important.
The ideas presented in this book are a radical departure from working on yourself or your relationship to bring about positive change. This book is about discovering a new way of seeing, a new way of looking at yourself, your life, and your relationships. It will require you to learn a few very simple principles that can shift the way you relate and the way you think about your life.
The two of us have found a far faster and more lasting
approach than that of picking on oneself and oneâ€™s partner and
making endless lists of resolutions designed to force ourselves
to behave in a more positive manner. We have discovered the
possibility of Instantaneous Transformation.
