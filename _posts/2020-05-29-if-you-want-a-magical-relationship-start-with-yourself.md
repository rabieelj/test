Most people focus on their partner as the source of their dissatisfaction and disharmony. In a transformation approach, it
is always your responsibility for how your relationship is going.
Our way of looking at it is to bring awareness to yourself and
what you are doing or not doing that is straining or stressing
the relationship. Please note that responsibility is not the same as saying problems are your “fault.” Responsibility is being willing to acknowledge that what happens in your relationship happens around you and that there is a way you are being or operating that is producing what you say you don’t like.
as saying problems are your “fault.” Responsibility is being
willing to acknowledge that what happens in your relationship
happens around you and that there is a way you are being or
operating that is producing what you say you don’t like.
When we work with couples, we treat their relationship
as though it is not a fi fty-fi fty deal. When we’re speaking to
one partner, we speak to that person as if the dynamic is 100
percent his or her responsibility. When we switch focus to the
second person, we speak to that partner as if the responsibility
for the dynamic is 100 percent his or hers. We have found this
an empowering way to look at how people relate, because even
if you were to have a different partner, your mechanical way
of relating would very likely trigger the same type of scenario
and “problems” that you have created in your current or past
relationships.
There is no “good” person and “bad” person in your relationship. The dynamics are generated between both of you.
We often think of it like Velcro. Velcro is made of two sides,
hooks and fluff. You need both in order to have something join.
If you don’t have fluff, then the hooks won’t stick. And if you
don’t have hooks, then the fluff has nothing to snag.
Your Relationship with Yourself Determines Your
Relationship with Your Partner
If you want to have your relationship grow and be nurturing
after love’s first blush, it is important to first take a look at
your relationship with yourself. In our most private thoughts,
the majority of us are very hard on ourselves. We are our own
harshest critics, finding fault with ourselves and thinking we
should do our lives differently or better.
Here is how thinking negatively about yourself directly
impacts your relationship. Let’s say when you are being self-critical and judgmental, you think of yourself as less, wrong,
stupid, inept, unsophisticated, fat, too old, unattractive, etc.
Then if someone finds you attractive, this person has a major
strike against him or her simply by the act of being attracted to you with all of your “faults.” It stands to reason that if you don’t like yourself, then, from this same logic system, the person who finds you attractive must be deficient somehow or, at the very
least, have bad taste and judgment. When you are hard on yourself, you are hard on any person related to you. If you demean yourself in your thoughts, you will, by association, transfer that way of relating to your partner and relationship. If you are out to fix your shortcomings, that new person in your life is destined to become your next fixer-upper project sooner or later. You will begin to try to get him or her to behave the right way, molding your partner into your ideal person in much the same way you try to mold yourself.
